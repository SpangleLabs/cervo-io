TODO list:

- Allow entering postcode any time on species_select.html
- Enable a better system to add species to zoos, perhaps with a grid of species and zoos and tickboxes
- Remove duplicates from locate_zoo when a zoo has many of the species selected
- Create a user front page to link things together

MAJOR:
- Some sort of website style
- Add some security to the admin system
